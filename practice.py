"""
Congrats! You started working as an algorithm developer for the IRS (Internal Revenue Service).
Your Team Leader gave you the first assignment which is to create a formula for collecting tax.
You should stick to the following rules:
1. Businesses with gross incomes in between 1 - 2k will pay 5% tax.
2. Businesses with gross incomes in between 2k - 5k will pay 10% tax.
3. Businesses with gross incomes in between 5k - 15k will pay 15% tax.
4. Above 15k , will all pay 17% tax from gross income.
5. All businesses will pay an additional 2% for healthcare out of net income as well, after tax reduction, and just print it.
6. Also calculate the total tax you got from the given 10 business in the list (exclude healthcare)
7. businesses_list = [1500, 2542, 2001, 3500, 5300, 5555, 17000, 21000, 10, 15001]
"""
businesses_list = [1500, 2542, 2001, 3500, 5300, 5555, 17000, 21000, 10, 15001]
total_taxes = 0

for income in businesses_list:
    if income >= 1000 and income <= 2000:
        tax = income * 0.05
    elif income >= 2000 and income <= 5000:
        tax = income * 0.1
    elif income >= 5000 and income <= 15000:
        tax = income * 0.15

# Part A
# 1. Create a list of ‘ages’ with the following values: 5 , 6, 24, 32, 21, 70
ages = [5 , 6, 24, 32, 21, 70]

# 2. The condition of the while loop should look for ages under 30

# 3. Each cycle in the while loop, should get a value out of the list
# (Hint : Use a counter)
counter = 0
while ages[counter] > 30:

# 4. Print each tested cell inside the loop
    print(ages[counter])
    counter += 1

# 5. Once the condition is false, print the cell that caused it
print(ages[counter])

# 6. Add empty new line between Part A and Part B
print('\n')

# Part B
# 1. Use the same list from Part A

# 2. Create a new while loop, with the same ‘stop’ condition as in Part A
counter = 0

# 3. Also, if the age is bigger then 20 - stop the ‘while’ loop from inside.
# Right before the stop of the loop, print the tested value out of the list

        print(ages[counter])
        break

# Part C
# 1. Create a while loop, based on the list from Part A.
# Loop’s condition should check whether the age is smaller than 70

# 2. On each cycle of the loop, change list’s cell to be ‘+2’ and print it
    ages[counter] = ages[counter] + 2

# “I’m inside ‘else’ because of *listCell*’
else:
    print("I'm inside 'else' because of number : " +str(ages[counter]))

# Part A
# Create a new method and call it ‘sorting’, that receives Arbitrary Arguments,
# and execute it 3 times with these variables passed to it :
# ● ‘Python’ & ‘Java’
# ● ‘Python’, ‘Java’, ’Go’
# ● ‘Python’, ‘JS’, ‘C++’
# Then, use a loop to find if “Java” is one of the values.
# Once “Java” is found, print each letter of it one-above-the-other in the output terminal.

# Part B
# 1. Create a method, and call it ‘tax_calculation’, it would get 2 variables : gross_salary, tax.
# Notice, that if no ‘tax’ variable is passed into the method, it should use 0.22 by default
# 2. Execute it 3 times with these values :
# ● 5000, 0.2
# ● 6000, 0.22
# ● 10000
# 3. Calculate the the ‘net_salary’ by reducing the ‘tax’ out of the ‘gross_salary’,
# and return it at the end of the method
# 4. Create a second method and call it ‘salary_limit_tester’, it should receive a
# ‘net_salary’ variable and check whether it is above or below ‘5800’
# 5. Whether the salary is above or below 5800, state it in a print, and mention
# the value of the tested salary
